sd# Juno Journey's Engineering Coding Task
## Instructions
This coding task is used to evaluate new hires for Juno Journey's Engineering Team.
You should [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository to your personal [Github](www.github.com) account.
Please share your forked copy after you finish with Juno Journey's Engineering Team.
The whole task should take around 1.5 hours.

All the code you write should work, should be clean, and use best practices you are familiar with.
Testing is recommended. 

## Structure
Your code should go under src/task1 & src/task2.
The api folder provides basic infrastructure to both tasks, and should be kept untouched.

## First Task:
Create an image carousel that looks similar to this (and not necessarily exact):
<img src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16q70tP7pVvbnZmIgdpQgvWuZ_WuPL0Jg/view?usp=sharing">
The carousel is circular - clicking "next" on the last image will show the first image, and clicking "previous" on the first image will show the last image.
Using material-UI components is a bonus. Please implement the carousel yourself, using third party libraries for this purpose is not allowed.

## Second Task:
Implement the TODOs in /task2/submission_e-commerce.js.

Consider an e-commerce website (Amazon for example) with DB which stores users' orders.
You should write 4 JavaScript functions, it is recommended to do it in the specified order. (question might be depending on its former):
Read also the instructions in the comments in the code
Query all the orders specified in the constant array, using the helper function that has already been imported from the utils file.
bucket the orders by users
Same as 1 but now the function should return only the orders from the last 2 weeks.
Bucket the data returned from the function from 3, by date.
